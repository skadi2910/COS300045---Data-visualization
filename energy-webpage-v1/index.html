        <h1>PowerTech - Energy Efficient Appliances</h1>

        <p><b>Welcome to PowerTech Australia</b></p>

        <p>
          PowerTech is Australia's leading provider of energy-efficient
          television solutions. We specialise in helping Australian households
          reduce their energy consumption while enjoying premium entertainment
          technology.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
          <p>
            The average Australian household spends $2,400 per year on
            electricity. Televisions account for approximately 8-12% of total
            household energy consumption. Choosing an energy-efficient TV can
            save you up to $200 annually on your electricity bill.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Australian Energy Market Overview</h2>

        <p>
          Australia has some of the highest electricity prices in the world,
          making energy efficiency more important than ever. The Australian
          Energy Market Operator (AEMO) reports that residential electricity
          prices have increased by 35% over the past five years.
        </p>

        <h3>Energy Star Ratings in Australia</h3>
        <p>
          All televisions sold in Australia must display an Energy Rating Label,
          showing star ratings from 1 to 10 stars. PowerTech specialises in 6+
          star rated televisions to ensure maximum energy savings for our
          customers.

        <h2>Understanding TV Energy Consumption in Australia</h2>

        <p>
          Television energy consumption varies significantly based on screen
          size, technology, and usage patterns. In Australia, the average
          household watches TV for 5.1 hours per day.
        </p>

        <h3>Factors Affecting Energy Consumption:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Screen Size:</strong> Larger screens generally consume more
            energy
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Display Technology:</strong> OLED and QLED are more
            efficient than older LCD/LED
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Brightness Settings:</strong> Higher brightness increases
            energy use by up to 30%
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Smart Features:</strong> Always-on internet connectivity
            adds 10-15W standby power
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Age:</strong> TVs older than 5 years use 20-40% more energy
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Energy Saving Tips</h3>
          <p>
            • Adjust brightness to 80% or use auto-brightness<br />
            • Enable power saving mode<br />
            • Turn off when not in use (don't leave on standby)<br />
            • Use sleep timer for bedtime viewing<br />
            • Regular software updates can improve efficiency
